.Sh DESCRIPTION          \" Section Header - required - don't modify
.Nm
contains definition of the type, scaling mode, defining atoms and scaling parameters
for all the internal coordinates that are used as a basis for the expansion of Hd.
.br
.Nm 
also sets the maximum order for each coordinate, as well as additional order
conditions in the form of linear inequality constraints.
.Pp
For coordinates that are related by symmetry operations, only one of them should be 
defined.  All the symmetry related coordinates will be automatically added to form 
a group of coordinates, refered to as
.Em coordinate sets .

.Sh INPUT FORMAT
The file consists of the definitions of coordinate sets and the additional
order conditions.  The entire file use automatic formating, positions and the 
number of spaces or length of numbers will not affect the input.
.Ss Coordinate and Condition Counts
First line of 
.Sy coord.in
is a comment line left for the user to describe the coordinate system.
.br
The second line consists of two integers, providing the number of coordinate sets
.Sy nCoordSets
and the number of additional conditions 
.Sy nAddCond .
./"   -->>>>>  definition of coordinate sets  --->>>>>>
.Ss Coordinate Set Definitions
Coordinate set definition is composed of the definition of each of the 
.Sy nCoordSets
coordinate sets.   For each coordinate, the definition consists of 3 or 4 
lines, depending on the type and scaling mode of coordinates.   
.Pp
.Sy General Format
.Pp
The first line is a comment line.
The second line consists of three integers, which defines the type, scaling mode 
and maximum order of the coordinate.  
When maximum order is set to 0, no maximum will be imposed on this coordinate.
.br
The third line consists of four numbers, 
.Em A1 , A2 , A3 
and 
.Em A4 .  
All or some of these
defines the indices of atoms that are involved in the coordinates.  For coordinate
types that involve less than 4 atoms, the last one or more integers will not be
used by the program.  However, all 4 numbers will still need to be present, even
though some are not used.  
.br
The fourth line is present for type-scaling mode combinations
that require scaling parameter input.  This line contains two floating point or
scientific numbers that will be used to define the coordinates.  This line should
.Sy ALWAYS
be present no matter coefficients are taken or not. 
.Pp
See the following section for details about the available coordinate types and
scaling modes and the number of scaling parameters needed for each combination.

.Sy Example
.Pp
This is an example for out-of-plane bend
.Bl -column xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx

.Pp
.Sy Coordinate Types
.Pp
The following coordinate types are currently implemented or planned:
.Bl -tag -width xxxxx
.It 0
Distance or scaled distance between two atoms.  The two atoms are permutable.
.It 1
Angle or scaled angle coordinate between 3 atoms, with the third atom being the vertex.
The two side atoms are permutable.
.It 2
Torsion or scaled torsion coordinate.
.It -1
Tetrahedron out-of-plane coordinate where all four vertices are permutable.  
The coordinate is defined from the scalar triple product of the three displacement
vectors launching from any one vertex
.Sy s=r1.(r2xr3) .
.It -2
Umbrella out-of-plane coordinate where 3 vertices are permutable, 
but one other atom is special.  
.br
.Sy The atom in position 1 is the special atom.
.br
The coordinate is defined from the scalar triple
product of the three displacement vector launching from the special atom
.Sy s=r1.(r2xr3) .
.br
When the distances are fixed and the scaling changes are not considered, the Tetrahedron
and Umbrella OOP coordinates describes the sine of out-of-plane angle.
.It -3
Four-center dot-product coordinates.  This type of coordinate describes the component
of angular motion that is symmetry with respect to inversion but anti-symmetric with
respect to permutations.  The unscaled coordinate has the form
.br
.Sy s=r12.r34/Norm[r12]/Norm[r34]
.br
When the distances are fixed and changes due to scalings are ignored, this coordinates
approximately describes the cosine of out-of-plane angle.
.El
.Pp
.Sy Scaling Modes
.Pp
.Em Scaling Modes for Distance Coordinates
.Pp
Scaling functions for all supported scaling modes of distance coordinates (
.Em type=0
) are given in the following list 
(All modes require 2 scaling parameters except for unscaled distance):
.Bl -tag -width xxxxxx
.It 0 
.Sy w=(r-c2)*c1
.It 1
Morse functions  
.Sy w= exp(-c1*(r-c2))
.It 2
Gaussian functions 
.Sy w=exp(-c1*(r-c2)**2)
.It 3
Leading term of screened Columb potential 
.Sy w=exp(-c1*(r-c2))/r 
(Yukawa potential)
.It 4
Long range term of screened Columb  
.Sy w=exp[c1*(c2-r)]*(r/c2)^(c1*c2)
.It 5
Lennard Jones potentials 
.Sy w=(c2/r)**c1
.It 6
Shifted(chasmless) Yukawa 
.Sy w=exp(-c1*(r-c2))/(r+c2)
.It 7
Smooth step function
.Sy w=tanh((r-c2)/c1)
.El
.Pp
.Em Scaling Modes for Angle Bends
.Pp
Supported scaling modes for angle bends (
.Em type=1
) are
.Bl -tag -width xxxxx
.It 0 
Unscaled
.Sy w=(t-c2)*c1 .  
No scaling parameters.
.It 1
Cosine scaling 
.Sy w=Cos(t) .  
No scaling parameters.
.It 2
Distance scaled cosine scaling
.Sy w=Cos(t)/( 1+exp[c1*(r1^2+r2^2-c2^2)] ) ,
where 
.Sy r1 
and 
.Sy r2 
are the sides of the angle.
Two scaling parameters 
.Sy c1 
and 
.Sy c2 
are required.
.El
.Pp
.Em Scaling Modes for Torsion Coordinates
.Pp
Torsion coordinates (
.Em type=2
) are not yet fully implemented.
.Pp
.Em Scaling Modes for Tetrahedron Out-of-Plane Coordinates
.Pp
Supported scaling modes for tetrahedron out-of-plane coordinates (
.Em type=-1
) are shown in the following list.  2 scaling parameters are always required.  
Here the scalar triple product
.Sy s=r1.(r2xr3) 
and 
.Sy ri
denotes the array of all 
.Em 6
internuclear distances.
.Bl -tag -width xxxxxxx
.It 0
Divide scalar triple product 
.Sy s 
by powers of the product of all 
.Em six 
distances: 
.Sy w=C2*s/Product[ri]^C1
.It mode>0
Use the product of scaled distances(with the same mode) between each of the 6
atom pairs to scale the scalar triple product
.br
.Sy w=s*Product[Scale[ri]]
.It mode<0
Use power of the reciprocal of
.Em sum
of the distances as the scaling factor
.Sy w=s*(C2/Sum[rij])^(C1+3)
.El
.Pp
.Em Scaling Modes for Umbrella OOP Coordinates
.Pp
Umbrella OOP coordinates (
.Em type=-2
) are similar to tetraheron OOP coordinates.  However,
they experience different permutational properties due to one of the atoms being
treated special permutationally.   Like in the case of tetrahedron OOPs, two 
scaling parameters are always required.  The scaling options for umbrella OOPs
are listed below.  Note that some of these options differ from the tetrahedron case.
.Bl -tag -width xxxxxxx
.It 0
Reciprocal scaled with 3 distances from the vertex
.Sy w=s/Product[ri]^C1
.It mode>0
.Em harmonic mean
of the three scaled distances as scaling factor and also divide the 
.Em square root 
of the product of all
.Em six
distances from the triple product:
.Sy w=s/Sqrt[r1.r2.r3.r4.r5.r6]/Sum[1/Scale[ri],i=1..3]
.br
This scaling mode is included to provide compatibility with scaling type=-1
mode=-1 in previously published ammonia surface.
.It mode<0
Use the 
.Em harmonic mean
of the three scaled distances as scaling factor and also divide the product of the
.Em three 
distances launching from the top vertex from the triple product:
.Sy w=s/(r1.r2.r3)/Sum[1/Scale[ri],i=1..3]
.br
Absolute value of the scaling mode is used for the scaling of each distances in the
harmonic mean.
.Em -mode
is used as the scaling mode for the distances and the scaling parameters are given
to them.
.El
.Pp
.Em Scaling Modes for Four-center Dot-product Coordinates
.Pp
4-Center dot-product coordinates (
.Em type=-3
) are compensate coordinates of the umbrella and tetrahedron OOP coordinates. This
coordinate is symmetric with respect to inversion and anti-symmetric with respect
to pair-wise permutations.  This coordinate is roughly the cosine of the out-of-plane
angle and is useful for describing angular motions that are symmetric with respect 
to inversions.  For example, when a bond rotates out of a plane and approaches 90 
degrees, the OOP coordinates reaches a maximum and their gradients vanishes.  The 
coupling along the rotation of this bond cannot be described by OOP coordinates but
can be well described by 4-center dot-products.  (added v2.1.3) 
.Bl -tag -width xxxxxxx
.It 0
Unscaled
.It >0 
Use the product of the scaled distances of between the 4 atom pairs a1-a3, a2-a3, a1-a4 
and a2-a4 as the scaling function.
.It <0
Use the 
.Em harmonic mean 
of the four scaled distances as the scaling function.
.br
.Em -mode
is used as the scaling modes for these four distances.
.El
.\"
.Ss Additional Order Conditions
Other than the maximum total order and total order for each coordinates, a set of
.Em additional conditions
can be used to further restrict the polynomial expansion in a more detailed manner.
Every addtional order condition implies one linear inequality constraint on the
orders of coordinate sets defined in the previous section.
.Pp
Each suction condition input occupies one line which contains 
.Sy nCoordSets+1
integers.  The first 
.Sy nCoordSet 
integers specify the multipliers for the order of each of the coordinate sets and
the last integer indicates the maximum of the weighed sum of orders.   
.Pp
For example, with 3 coordinate sets, the condition
.br
.Sy 2   1   0   6
.br
Implies that
.Em (total order of set 1)
*2+
.Em (total order of set 2)
<=6
.Pp
Total order of a coordinate set means the sum of the orders of all the coordinates
that are defined in a coordinate set, whether it is a coordinate directly specified
in the coordinate set definitin section, or a coordinate generated by a symmetry
operation.
