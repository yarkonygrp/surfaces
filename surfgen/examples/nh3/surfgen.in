jobtypes: 
-1 = give symmetry operations 
 0 = do nothing 
 1 = perform fit 

Irreducible representation matrices are given in irrep.in
states are partitioned into groups that each n-state group carries an n-dimensional irrep.  
groupsym specifies the irreducible those groups carry.
The numbers correspond to the index in irrep.in.
groupprty specifies the parity of each group.
